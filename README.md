(GA Software Engineering Immersive - Project 1)

# 1. 🕹 Play here:
https://oldermcdonald.github.io/Tic-Tac-Tron/


# 2. 📜 Project Brief:
To build an interactive front-end app that functions as a tic tac toe game, styled with CSS and given a Tron theme. Built with HTML, CSS and Javascript.


# 3. 💻 Game Features:
Live score board, adjustable board size (3x3 up to 6x6), adjustable win condition (ie 3 or 4 in a row to win), reset function, responsive design via flexbox, css animations and neon effects.


# 4. 🏋️ Key Challenges: 
This was my first front-end project involving DOM manipulation and creation of elements with Javascript and I learned a bunch of new things including writing the algorithms to determine the winning conditions. As I wanted to create a board that could be increased in size the biggest challenge was coming up with the win condition for diagonal matches especially when not counting the entire row.


# 5. 🕒 Project Timing
Made in class over 2 days
